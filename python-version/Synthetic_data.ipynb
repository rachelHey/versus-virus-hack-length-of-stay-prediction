To augment such monitoring capability, predictive modeling techniques that forecast how long a patient will remain hospitalized will be applied. Such approach allows for a more accurate resource planning of hospital beds and distribution of patients across Swiss hospitals.\n","The following approach was taken to generate the data:\n","\n","1. Use a data synthesizer to produce ~10k hospital patients (source: https://github.com/theodi/synthetic-data-tutorial)\n","\n","2. Adjust synthetic data to Switzerland and current time frame (March/April 2020)\n","\n","3. Map data to number of beds available in Swiss hospitals (source: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uSisBqRAgp-cNlYPePOUF4YX_idp0JaeZEVyY3MbaJk/edit#gid=0)\n","\n","4. Sample data according to volume of ICU beds available in Swiss hospitals\n","\n","5. Sample admission type : ICU invasive, ICU non-invasive, Non-ICU (source: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html)\n","\n","6. Augment data with patient information about symptoms & preconditions and sample according to frequency of occurrence (source: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044)\n","\n","7. Engineer duration of stay based on admission type & death occurrence (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html , https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm#T1_down)\n","\n","*Please note that not all assumptions have been available prior generation of the data and some might deviate from the underlying literature.
